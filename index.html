      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="body-ptag">Being a full stack developer has broadened my horizons in many ways but I still wake up every day trying to widen them a little bit more. I've just
        recently completed a Bachelors of Science studying Nutritional Sciences and also earned a certificate in Full Stack Web-Development at the University of Arizona.
      </p>

      <p class="body-ptag">  None of us expected the COVID-19 pandemic but we all faced new challenges, and one challenge I voluntarily presented to myself
        was to learn how to code. I'm an outdoors person at heart and love hiking so I'm always looking for my next mountain to climb, literally
       and figuratively. The Coding Bootcamp with the University of Arizona was exactly that in 2020; extremely intense and fast paced but exposed me
      to some extremely valuable skills and programs.

      <h3>Frontend Applications:</h3>

        MongoDB, Mongoose, Robo 3T, Node JS, and Express</p>

      <p class="body-ptag">Previous employment opportunities have given me the valuable time of not only working with customers and the public, but also amongst a team with common goals.
        In settings like construction, fast food, fashion, and football you get a little bit of everything, and I enjoyed every minute of it. These occupations gave me
        experience in data collection, group presentation, time management, creating schedules, delegating responsibilities, and customer service.
