      <h2>About</h2>
      <p class="body-ptag">Being a full stack developer has broadened my horizons in many ways but I still wake up every day trying to widen them a little bit more. I've just
        recently completed a Bachelors of Science studying Nutritional Sciences and also earned a certificate in Full Stack Web-Development at the University of Arizona.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="body-ptag"> None of us expected the COVID-19 pandemic but we all faced new challenges, and one challenge I voluntarily presented to myself
        was to learn how to code. I'm an outdoors person at heart and love hiking so I'm always looking for my next mountain to climb, literally
        and figuratively. The Coding Bootcamp with the University of Arizona was exactly that in 2020; extremely intense and fast paced but exposed me
        to some extremely valuable skills and programs.

      <h3>Frontend Applications:</h3>
      <p>HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and React</p>
      <h3>Backend Applications</h3>
      <p class="body-ptag">MySQL, SQL, password encryption, data storage and selection,
        MongoDB, Mongoose, Robo 3T, Node JS, and Express</p>

      <p class="body-ptag">Previous employment opportunities have given me the valuable time of not only working with customers and the public, but also amongst a team with common goals.
        In settings like construction, fast food, fashion, and football you get a little bit of everything, and I enjoyed every minute of it. These occupations gave me
        experience in data collection, group presentation, time management, creating schedules, delegating responsibilities, and customer service.

      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      <p class="body-ptag">Over the course of my short coding career I've been lucky enough to
        work on projects with other developers while also keeping busy during my own time creating more
        projects and trying new ideas. As a developer, I've realized how much time and patience is needed
        to grow in this field so practicing and learning new code is always in my daily schedule. This is a
        small list of projects I've personally created or helped create in the recent past.

        <h3><a href="https://stormy-waters-93393.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">ShipMaster</a></h3>
        <p class="project-ptag">ShipMaster was a collaberative project that I worked on with some
          folks that were in my Bootcamp and it was developed to help users manage their package shipments.
          ShipMaster also enables users to see which carrier will be shipping their package (unfortunatley, not
          carriers are recognized). Utilizing ReactStrap allowed us to design a UI that would benifit the user's
          ability to navigate the site. User's are able to create accounts by entering their email and password.
          Each search is done by entering a tracking number and the user will be given information on their shipment.
